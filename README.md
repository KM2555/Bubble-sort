Bubble sort project

By KM2555

 Bubble sort algorith in C. It demonstrates how to sort both alphabetic characters and small interger numbers stored as char.

The bubble_sort() function repeatedly steps through the array, compares adjacent elements using a function pointer, and swaps them if they
are not in the desired order.

Customization
To change the array contents, modify the definitions of letter_arr and number_arr in main().
